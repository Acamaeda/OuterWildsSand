# I Don't Like Sand
Is the sand on Ash Twin and Ember Twin coarse, rough, irritating, and getting everywhere? Let's just get rid of it.

(Most of the sandfalls are still there because they would take forever to remove. The ones blocking the HEL were removed though.)

Known bugs (which I am not planning to remove because they would take much more than the 1 hour of effort I was willing to put into a random mod suggestion):
- Door orbs don't work if they would be covered by sand
- Scout photos don't work in areas that would be covered by sand
